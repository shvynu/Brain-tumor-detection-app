## Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Project

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a brain tumor detection and classification project. The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can accurately detect and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans.

### Features

- Preprocessing techniques for enhancing brain tumor images.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for tumor detection and classification.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the models.
- Example datasets and data augmentation techniques for training and testing the models.
- Visualization tools for analyzing the results and generating insights.

### Key Components

1. Data Preprocessing: This module includes techniques for image preprocessing, such as noise reduction, intensity normalization, and image registration, to enhance the quality of the input data.

2. Tumor Detection: Different algorithms and deep learning models are implemented for identifying potential tumor regions in brain scans. This involves segmentation and localization of tumor areas.

3. Tumor Classification: This component focuses on classifying the detected tumors into specific types or grades using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves feature extraction, feature selection, and model training.

4. Evaluation and Visualization: This section provides evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models and tools for visualizing the results, including generating heatmaps, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
